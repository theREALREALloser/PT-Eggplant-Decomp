theres some states or "enums" that im missing but those are either not important or things that i dont need to add examples are: create_particle, particle_set_scale, anything releated to bosses, monsters, the tv object and possibly more
i hope you understand when i have to add a new enum state to every. single. state. in the game's code which really annoying,
anyways dont ask me to add more enums states into this or im gonna go crazy
